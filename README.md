# Building simple REST apis with Nodejs
This Repo is inspired by [Aditya's blog](https://adityasridhar.com/posts/how-to-use-nodejs-without-frameworks-and-external-libraries).
## Pre-requisite
Make sure have NodeJS installed. (Refer to https://nodejs.org/ to download it if not.)
## Pre-knowledge
To understand **Localhost** see:
[What is localhost?](https://whatismyipaddress.com/localhost#:~:text=On%20almost%20all%20networking%20systems,loopback%20address%20is%20%3A%3A1.)

To further understand how **IP address**, **localhost** and **services** relate to each other see: [What's the difference between IP address and localhost?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/184447/whats-the-difference-between-a-machines-ip-address-and-localhost#:~:text=So%2C%20to%20answer%20your%20question,virtual%20loopback%20network%20device%20lo%20.&text=A%20system%20that%20is%20not,device%20and%20hence%20a%20127.0.)
